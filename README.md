# Tom-s-Big-Sandbox-Bash
A Z80 assembly game complete with physics, collision, haiku's, and Tom himself!
*I apologize in advance for the file structure*

This was a game that I made as a helping during my internship at Iron Galaxy Studios.
All systems and concepts were designed by me, for better or worse.

## Setup
To play the game, you need an emulator, and I used a program called Easy68k.
It is only available for Windows atm, here is the [download link]([url](http://www.easy68k.com/files/SetupEASy68K.exe)http://www.easy68k.com/files/SetupEASy68K.exe).

For non-Windows users, choose any other emulator, however, it is worth noting that
Easy68k allows for two-byte alignment. I am aware some Z80 systems, like the Sega Genisis had four-byte alignment.
My program definitely relies on two-byte alignment, so just a heads-up.

## Playing the Game
Simply open *Sandbox.X68* (my main file) in your emulator and run the program. 
In Easy68k this is achieved through F9 or the little play button on the top toolbar.

The goal is to match my boss' sandcastle on the left side of the screen by dropping
the available blocks at the bottom of the screen. There are five levels, see if you can
beat all of them!

## Controls
* Select Block: A and D keys, or click the boxes above the respective block.
* Drop Block: Left Click on the right side of the Screen.
* Rotate Block:
